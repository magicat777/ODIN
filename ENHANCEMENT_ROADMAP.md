## üìã Implementation Priority

### Quick Wins (1-2 days each)
1. **E9**: Slack/Discord webhook integration
2. **E6**: Basic TTS alerts
3. **E4**: Simple self-healing rules

### Medium Effort (1 week each)
1. **E2**: Claude API cost prediction
2. **E7**: Basic correlation engine
3. **E10**: CI/CD metrics collection

### Major Projects (2-4 weeks each)
1. **E1**: Full anomaly detection system
2. **E5**: Mobile dashboard app
3. **E8**: Capacity planning suite

## üöÄ Getting Started

To implement any enhancement:

1. Create a new branch: `feature/enhancement-<ID>`
2. Update ISSUE_TRACKER.md with implementation tasks
3. Follow existing patterns for consistency
4. Add documentation in `/docs/enhancements/`
5. Include tests and monitoring for new features

## üìä Success Metrics

Each enhancement should be measured by:
- **Adoption**: % of users utilizing the feature
- **Impact**: Reduction in incidents/MTTR
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback scores
- **ROI**: Time saved vs development effort
