# Process CPU Usage Heatmap Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-05-30

### Issue
The Host Process Monitoring dashboard was missing a Process CPU Usage Heatmap panel. The dashboard only had traditional timeseries and table visualizations for process monitoring.

### Solution
Added a new heatmap panel (ID: 12) to visualize process CPU usage patterns over time.

### Heatmap Configuration
- **Type**: Heatmap
- **Data Source**: Prometheus
- **Query**: `sum by (groupname) (rate(namedprocess_namegroup_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) * 100`
- **Format**: heatmap
- **Interval**: 30s
- **Color Scheme**: Spectral (with exponential scale)
- **Position**: Bottom of dashboard (y: 48, height: 10)

### Features
1. **Visual Pattern Recognition**: The heatmap makes it easy to spot:
   - Periodic CPU spikes
   - Consistent high CPU usage processes
   - Anomalous behavior patterns
   
2. **Color Coding**: 
   - Uses Spectral color scheme
   - Exponential scale for better differentiation
   - Dark orange fill for intensity

3. **Process Grouping**: Shows all monitored process groups (194 total) with their CPU usage intensity over time

### Verification
- Confirmed 194 process groups are being monitored
- Top CPU consumers visible: python3 (39.9%), node (25.7%), chrome (23.5%)
- Data format compatible with Grafana heatmap visualization

### Access
Visit the updated dashboard at: http://localhost:31494/d/host-process-monitor/host-process-monitoring-ubuntu-22-04

The heatmap is located at the bottom of the dashboard and provides a comprehensive view of process CPU usage patterns across all monitored processes.
